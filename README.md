# README

The goal of MagicLib is to create a community-built library of useful (and well documented) scripts and plugins that can
be leveraged and contributed to by every modder.

## Combat Activators to MagicSubsystems Migration Guide

- Rename from Activators to MagicSubsystems.
    - Change your imports from `activators` to `org.magiclib.subsystems`.
    - Change `ActivatorManager` to `MagicSubsystemsManager`.
    - Change `CombatActivator` to `MagicSubsystem`.
    - (etc)
- `advance(float amount)` and `advanceEveryFrame()` are now a single method, `advance(float amount, boolean isPaused)`.
    - All logic that was in `advanceEveryFrame` before should move to `advance`, which is now called even when paused.
    - All logic that was in `advance` before should have `if (!isPaused)` added around it.
- `ActivatorManager.addActivator` has been renamed to `MagicSubsystemsManager.addSubsystemToShip`.
  - Same with similar methods.

Bonus: Kotlin extension methods for adding/removing subsystems have been added on `ShipAPI`.


## Todo add this to the wiki

for the new magiclib version there's new ordering parameter
```
MagicSubsystem.getOrder()
    protected static int ORDER_MOD_MODULAR = 4;
    protected static int ORDER_MOD_UNIQUE = 5;
    protected static int ORDER_FACTION_MODULAR = 6;
    protected static int ORDER_FACTION_UNIQUE = 7;
    protected static int ORDER_SHIP_MODULAR = 8;
    protected static int ORDER_SHIP_UNIQUE = 9;
```
these are the suggested values but you can use anything
the default is 0
if two subsystems have the same "Order", then it picks alphabetically by display name
highest "Order" gets first key index and renders first
