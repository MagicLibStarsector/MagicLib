They even went as far as to make an announcement when entering the $system_name system! This is an outrage, and proof of the utter disregard from the rich about the 99%% yadda yadda yadda.\nThe part that interests me, and by extension the reader of this note, is that in the Tri-Tachyon influential spheres there is always something to gain from shining a light on the antics of one's troublesome heir. Find the fleet, destroy it. The target's survival is irrelevant, we will have our media coverage ready before the deed is done.\nTime is of the essence here.",
